## Building Data Products Coursera Project (leaflets)

This project is done as part of Building Data Products course conducted by John Hopkins University through Coursera. This is done as part of Week3 lesson (R Markdown Presentation & Plotly)

### Instructions

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

#### Review criteria

The rubric contains the following two questions:

1. Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?
